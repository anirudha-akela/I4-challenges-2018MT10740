Challenge VI: Inferring Real Citizen Behavior from Google Search patterns

Background: An unprecedented amount of implicit knowledge about human behavior, judgments and decisions can be inferred by looking at what people do online. A predominant activity is searching for information. Google Search is one of the obvious storehouse for such interests we hone and look for. Google Trends gives aggregate interest of specific search
terms in a time-lined manner, specific to different geographical regions. Can we infer about real world events before it occurs by looking at such kinds of search patterns on Google (via trends.google.com)? For example, can you look for specific political election results and corelate it with the interest on Google people had shown for that party? Specifically, given the results of previous political elections (the change in seat share, percentage of votes and final election results in the different constituencies or cities in a state for Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha elections) and interest in those parties as evidenced from search volumes on Google; what can we infer?

Pick on a state and election results (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha), download the search data from Google trends for the leading party and its opposition(s) [primary and secondary] to draw evidence on what is the relation between what people searched on Google and how they
acted as a group of voters. The results of elections are available on Wikipedia pages or even on pages by the Election Commission of India. The search data is available from Trends.google.com (which can be comparative) and downloadable in csv format for a time range. Can you find any relations and build a predictive model that help us predict the future
election results solely based on Google search patterns?

Deliverables:
(1) Data gathered from Trends for a geographical region (state in India) along with key
phrases and categorized based on cities in that state. E.x., West Bengal. Look for data for
Web search, YouTube search. This data is a numerical score of relative interest over time.
(between 0 to 100).
(2) Data gathered about political outcomes for the same region â€“ Actual election results and
Poll results by TV channels (including aggregate poll prediction) for Lok Sabha elections and
for Rajya Sabha Elections for one state (say, West Bengal). Analyze 3 Lok Sabha elections:
2009, 2014, 2019 and 3 Rajya Sabha elections / Assembly elections in 2006, 2011, 2016.

(3) A predictive model that uses (1) to predict some aspects of (2)
Ideally: Use a few states and test the model to predict few other states .
(4) A map of key phrases (related topics) and (related queries) that lead the search interest for
each party in those specific years just before and after the elections.
Here is an example of data about 3 political parties from 2004 to 2020 in West Bengal
